# AI-Scrum-Master

## Overview
AI-Scrum-Master is an AI-powered Slack bot designed to automate the extraction of insights from team standups, generate actionable reports for individuals and teams, and recognize key contributors for company awards. Built by Team AImigos for the BBD AI Hackathon 2025, our solution aligns with the hackathonâ€™s theme of **GAINS** by empowering teams to work smarter and recognize excellence.
